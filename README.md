# Malaria_classification
This repository is dedicated to the classification of malaria cells into parasitized and non-parasitized categories using cutting-edge supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques. 

# Key Features:
Machine Learning Techniques: supervised machine learning methodologies like Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning methodologies like Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are employed to enhance the accuracy of our malaria cell classification models.

Model Comparison: The core of this project involves comparing the results obtained from different classification models. Through this comparative analysis, the most effective model for accurately distinguishing between parasitized and non-parasitized malaria cells within image data is identified.

Metrics Evaluation: The evaluation process is extensive by incorporating a range of metrics to provide a nuanced understanding of each classification model's performance. This includes accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and matthews correlation constant.
